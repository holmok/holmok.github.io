            <h1>Nothing, yet.</h1>
            <p>Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. This should be interesting.</p>
            <p>When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? What? We're not at all alike! Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Computer, belay that order. </p>
            <p>Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. I am your worst nightmare! You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every</p>
            <p>alternative and then you made the hard choice. Well, that's certainly good to know. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Why don't we just give</p>
            <p>everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. Your shields were failing, sir. Shields up! Rrrrred alert! How long can two people talk about nothing? Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, </p>
            <p>human history would be far less bloody. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. Not if I weaken first. Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp.</p>
